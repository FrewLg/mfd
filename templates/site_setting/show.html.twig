What is the level of acceptance of the proposed billing and collection system as perceived by the respondents in terms of; 3.1 Consumers' account updating; 3.2 auto-reminding the consumers for bills due for payment; and 3.3 billing statement printing and free format report generation.
5. Materials and Methods
The study used the descriptive research method, to describe the procedures from meter reading to encoding to the spreadsheet billing system that the local government unit is currently using. Descriptive because it is also used to evaluate the proposed system in terms of software functionality, usability, reliability, portability, and efficiency. The actual users of the spreadsheet billing system on the administrator side and the staff of Mulanay Water Sanitation and Services Unit consisting of six (6) persons were the first group of respondents. All of them were purposively selected as respondents of the study. For the second group of the respondents, 81 out of 102 household water consumers were the second group of respondents. Simple random technique was utilized in selecting the clients/household consumers. Simple random refers to a subset of individuals (samples) for a larger set (population). Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that individuals have the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. A simple random sampling is an unbiased surveying technique. In finding the sample size, the researcher employed the Slovin's formula for the computation of the sample size to identify the number of household consumers. Following were the several techniques employed by the researcher to gather pertinent data regarding the study.
6. Research Instrument
Interviews. Often interviews with the respondents were conducted by means of oral, phone call and even exchanging text messages in order to elicit information that will suffice in the development of the proposed system.
Questionnaire. The researcher formulated questionnaire based on his readings and searching on the web on how to evaluate a system. The questionnaire was employed to retrieve respondents' feedback about their current system and the proposed system.
In getting the level of agreement of the respondents on the issues and challenges faced by the Municipal Water Sanitation and Services Unit administration using the existing billing system in terms of consumers' account updating and free format report generation, the Likert scale below was used.

In evaluating the developed system, the ISO 9126 - International Organization for Standardization were utilized, depicted in figure as shown below;
System Architecture
The system framework will depend on the connection of web services in the Internet as the researcher will subscribe to host the online application and the database system.
8. Software Prototype Model
Software prototyping is becoming very popular as a software development model, as it enables to understand customer requirements at an early stage of development. It helps get valuable feedback from the customer and helps the researcher understand about what exactly is expected of the system to be developed.
Following is the stepwise approach to design a software prototype:
9. Basic Requirement Identification
This step involves understanding the very basics of product requirements especially in terms of user interface. The more intricate details of the internal design and external aspects like performance and security can be ignored at this stage.
10. Developing the Initial Prototype
This is the stage where the initial prototype is developed, where the very basic requirements are showcased and user interfaces are provided. These features may not exactly work the same manner internally in the actual software developed and the workarounds are used to give the same look and feel to the end-users in the prototype developed.
11. Review of the Prototype
The prototype developed is then presented to the end-users and the other important stakeholders in the study. The feedback is collected in an organized manner and used for further enhancements in the system under development.
12. Revise and Enhance the Prototype
The feedback and the review comments are discussed during this stage and some negotiations happen with the end-user based on factors like, time and budget constraints and technical feasibility of actual implementation. The changes accepted are again incorporated in the new prototype developed and the cycle repeats until end-users expectations are met [20].
13. Data Gathering Procedure
Actual interview to the water and services unit personnel and administration of the formal questionnaire was administered by the researcher.
With regard to the household consumers, the researcher then provided questionnaires and sought the help of his college students for the easy and massive distribution of the questionnaire to the respondents, and also for the technical assistance while the respondents tried/evaluated the proposed system.
The researcher then requested the volunteer students to bring with them an android/smartphone that were capable of connecting and browsing the web specifically the uniform resource locator (url) of the proposed water billing system. The researcher then provided them with cash to load their mobile devices then connect to the internet. He demonstrated to the data gatherers how the proposed system works specifically the clients' side of the system. The researcher then had an actual demonstration of the system to a certain group of respondents in order to speedily conduct and retrieve the survey instrument.
The researcher also let the admin/end users to try the proposed billing system allowing them to try it. He even provided a wireless broadband, laptop and android phone just to show to the end users the actual capabilities of the proposed system.
The system was evaluated carefully by the end respondents with regard to the evaluation form and guide / user's manual.
The results were tabulated and computed using mean, frequency, percentage and ranking to conclude if the system is acceptable.
14. Internet
The researcher used the information super hi-way, the World Wide Web to gather accurate data and document that is significant to the study critically in the field of Information and Communication Technology before, specifically on matters related to a computer-based testing system.
15. Library Research Method
The researcher used the library research method to gather data about past studies, literature or projects that were similar to the proposed system. The researched materials then helped the researcher to formulate survey instruments, present statistical data and research format.
16. Observations
Observation was done when the users were using the proposed system's prototype.
17. Development Tools
The researcher used MySQL as a database engine, PHP for web development and other plug-ins as need arises.
MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.
Oracle drives MySQL innovation, delivering new capabilities to power next generation web, cloud, mobile and embedded applications [14].
The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP. It is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is also integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server [27].
CodeIgniter is a powerful open-source PHP framework with a very small footprint, created by Rick Ellis in 2006. CodeIgniter was born from Expression Engine, essentially a collection of refactored classes originally written for Ellis Lab's flagship CMS. Stripped of the application-specific functionality, CodeIgniter was made to be a simple and elegant toolkit, enabling rapid development of both web sites and web applications, attracting thousands of talented PHP developers.
In an environment now saturated with PHP frameworks, CodeIgniter was for a long time the only solid choice for a developer who lived in the real world of shared hosting accounts and clients with deadlines. CodeIgniter flew in the face of ponderously large and thoroughly undocumented frameworks, leading PHP's creator Rasmus Lerdorf, an outspoken critic of frameworks, to praise CodeIgniter [7].
18. Statistical Treatment of Data
The researcher utilized the following statistical tools for the treatment of the gathered data.

    Percentage – this was also utilized because it was the commonly used with nominal variables and in frequency tables. where:p = percentagef = frequencyn = total population
    Mean. The researcher utilized this because it was the easiest and simplest way of evaluating the proposed system. where:x¯

 = Average of the total respondents rating in each criteriax = average of respondents responsesn
 = total number of respondents
RANK.AVG (Excel Statistical Function) Returns the rank of a number in a list of numbers: its size relative to other values in the list; if more than one value has the same rank, the average rank is returned.RANK.AVG (number,ref,order)where:Number (Required). The number whose rank you want to find.Ref (Required). An array of, or a reference to, a list of numbers. Nonnumeric values in ref are ignored.Order (Optional). A number specifying how to rank number.If order is 0 (zero) or omitted, Microsoft Excel ranks number as if ref were a list sorted in descending order.If order is any nonzero value, Microsoft Excel ranks number as if ref were a list sorted in ascending order.
Weighted Arithmetic Mean - arithmetic mean computed by considering relative importance of each items [26]. Where:X¯¯¯w
 Stands for weighted arithmetic mean.x Stands for values of the items andw Stands for weight of the item
